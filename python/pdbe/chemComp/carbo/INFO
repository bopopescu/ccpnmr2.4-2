- need exact stereochem on all centers as well. Write code to do this?

- INCLUDE magnetisation states?!?

- stereo codes are 'stereo_1:' and 'stereo_2:', with _n corresponding to the
  atom subType! If have multiple sites, would end up with something like:
   stereo_1:C1,C4;stereo_2:C6, or something.
