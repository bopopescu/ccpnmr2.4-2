Project : Save
==============

**Save the current CCPN project to disk**

This option writes out the information contained within the current CCPN project
session to disk. If the project has been saved before then the data is simply
stored in the project directory that was used before.

If the project has not been saved before a new project directory, usually named
after the project, will be created. In this instance the `Save As`_ dialogue
will be opened so that the user has a chance to review the location of the saved
information before committing the data to disk for the first time.

.. _`Save As`: ../popups/SaveProjectPopup.html
