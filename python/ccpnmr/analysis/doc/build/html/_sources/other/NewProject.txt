=====================
Project : New project
=====================

**Start a new CCPN project session**

This option makes a new, blank CCPN project to which data may be added.

If an existing CCPN project is active, the user will be prompted and has the
option to cancel the operation. Otherwise, any existing project will be closed
before a new project is created, although the user will be asked whether the
previous project should be saved. 

To make a new project the user is prompted to enter a short textual name. This
name will identify the project amongst others and will be used as the name of
the directory that will hold all of the CCPN XML files for the project. It
should be noted that spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters are not
permitted in the name. The new project will not be saved to disk unless the user
specifically elects to do so.
