=====================
Project : Preferences
=====================

**Set user specific options**

This submenu allows the user to dictate various options within Analysis in a way that
effects all CCPN projects opened by a given user on a given computer. Accordingly,
such preferences are not usually stored inside the CCPN project itself, rather the
data is stored in the user's home directory within the ".ccpn" sub-directory. These
settings are saved to disk at the same time as the main CCPN project data.

Fonts
=====

This sub-menu allows the user to control which typeface, in terms of size and style,
is used for the main graphical user interface within Analysis. Changing the font
affects all of the menus, tables and buttons etc.

Colour Schemes 
==============

Allows the user to setup named groups of colours that are used in various places
throughout the Analysis program, for example to use as spectrum contour colours. This
option opens the appropiate tab of the larger `User Options`_ popup window.

Residue Codes 
=============

Allows the user to specify custom residue codes when displaying molecular information.
For example the default preferences profile maps the DNA "A" residue code to "Ade".
The user may specify codes for residues from various molecule types. This
option is most useful for providing shorter or more readable alternatives to complex
residue names, like those commonly used for substituted monosaccharides. This
option opens the appropiate tab of the larger `User Options`_ popup window.

User Options
============

Gives access to main program-wide user-specific preferences that affect the behaviour
and appearance of the CcpNmr Analysis program. This option opens the main tab of the
larger `User Options`_ popup window, the overall contents of which are listed below.
