**Predict Protein Secondary Structure**

This popup window is designed to allow the prediction of secondary structure
for a protein chain given chemical shifts, using the (external) program D2D.

The Options to select are the Chain and the Shift List, for which the
prediction is then made.

The Secondary Structure Predictions table lists the residues in the chain.
For each residue the residue number, residue type and current secondary
structure set for that residue is given.  The remaining columns are for
the predictions made by D2D, and of course are only filled in once D2D
is run.  The predicted secondary structure is listed first, followed by
the probability of that residue being Helix, Beta, Coil or PPII (the
predicted secondary structure will be specified by the maximum of these).

To run the prediction click on the "Run D2D Prediction!" button.  This
does not store this information in the project.  To do that you have to
click on the "Commit Predicted Secondary Structure" button.

**Caveats & Tips**

The predicted secondary structure cell is coloured red if the prediction
is unreliable.  Unreliable predictions are not stored with the "Commit"
button but all reliable ones are.  If you need to edit the secondary
structure for a residue then use the Secondary Structure Chart:
