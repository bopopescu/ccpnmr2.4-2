**Create Automatic Project Backup**

The purpose of this dialog is to allow the user to create backups
of their project automatically.  The XML files for the backup go
into a separate directory from the project itself.  If the project
directory is called PROJECTDIR then the default for the backup
directory is PROJECTDIR_backup, although that can be changed to
something else in this dialog.

Other than the backup directory, the user can specify the frequency
of the backup, in minutes.

The "Apply Auto Settings" does not have to be applied if the user
has changed the on/off setting or if the user has changed the
Auto-backup frequency and entered a carriage return.

The "Do Immediate Backup" is in case the user wants to do a backup
then and there.

There is no backup for the backup.
