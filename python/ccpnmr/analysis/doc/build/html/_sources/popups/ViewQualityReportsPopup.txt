**Analyses of Potential Errors and Completeness in Assignment**

This popup presents a series of tables that enables the user to get a sense of
how complete the assignment is within a given project and whether there are
any assignments which look like they might be mistakes. This system is not
designed to say that something is definitely missing or definitely a mistake,
but rather tries to focus attention to any places where there may potentially
be a problem. Often something that is highlighted in red as "unusual" merely
needs checking, to ensure that the user has a good explanation. The layout
consists of four tabs, each relating to a different aspect of assignment.

**Atom Assign Status**

The first tab contains various categories of atom, from the selected molecular
system, like "backbone" or "Lys" (for amino acid type lysine). Each category
has an indication of how many, out of the total available for that type, have
been assigned and what chemical shift range they cover. This kind of
information is useful to track the assignment progress of a project and to
give a final summary. By default the table represents the atoms in the whole
of the selected molecular system, but the user may specify only a subset by
typing the appropriate chain letters and residue ranges into the "Residue
Selection" field.

**Through-Space Status**

The second tab contains a table that gives the counts of various classes of
through-space connection, e.g. for NOESY experiments. Counts are given on a
per-chain and per-residue basis. In this way the user can gauge the
information density that has been or may be used during structure calculation.
By default the table shows data for all peak lists that have and experiment
type that is deemed to be "through-space", like NOESY or solid-state
dipole-dipole. Data may be displayed for only one of these peak lists by
selecting from the "Peak List" pulldown menu.

**Resonances**

The third table considers all of the resonances that carry chemical shifts in
a specified shift list. The purpose of this table is to indicate potential
problems with assignment from the perspective of a resonance, rather than
peaks, which are covered in the next tab. Three basic category of error
are highlighted (and appear as red cells):


- Each resonance is checked for which others it has covalent bond type
  connectivity to, considering both atom assignments and the peak dimensions
  it is assigned to. Typical errors include hydrogens with more than one bound
  partner and carbons with more than four. Often errors are the result or
  (redundant) resonance duplication.

- The chemical shift of the resonance is compared to the known shift
  distribution derived from BioMagResBank data. Outliers are coloured yellow,
  orange or red in the "Type Score" column according to how unusual
  the chemical shift is. Even red warnings may actually represent correct
  atomic assignments, but the user should be able to conform the assignment.

- The distribution of peak dimension position information, from which the
  chemical shifts are derived, is used to fill the "SD" (standard deviation)
  and "Max Peak U+0394" columns. The former gives and indication of the width
  of spread in the shift measurement, and is weighted by spectrum dimension,
  like all shift measurements in Analysis. The later represents the biggest
  difference between the chemical shift value (an average) and peak dimension
  position; and thus is useful for finding outliers, especially where the
  number of measurements is large and the standard deviation is small.


The user may eliminate rows from the table which do not carry any warnings
by selecting the "Show only alerts" option.

**Peaks**

For a selected peak list, the forth table displays assignment and intensity
problems on a per-peak basis. Two basic kinds of check are made for each peak:


- For each peak any resonances assigned to its dimensions are analysed to
  highlight potential errors. Some of the checks mirror those found in the
  "Resonances" tab, e.g. looking for inappropriate covalent bond context.
  Checks include: missing assignments, like on one side of a covalent pair
  for an HSQC peak, and seemingly impossible assignments, like having an
  HSQC peak assigned to two resonances from different residues.

- The intensity (height and volume) measures for each peak are compared to the
  average for the whole peak list and significant outliers are highlighted.
  For magnitude comparisons peak heights and volumes are compared in
  log-space, and red cells indicate three standard deviations from the sample
  mean of the logarithm of the intensity. Warnings may indicate the presence
  of problems, like unintentional diagonal peaks, but some very intense or
  very weak peaks may be expected. A check is also made if the peak sign seems
  inappropriate e.g. peaks of opposite sign in a NOESY experiment.


The user may eliminate rows from the table which do not carry any warnings
by selecting the "Show only alerts" option.


**Caveats & Tips**

Because the analyses are relatively slow to perform the tables will not
automatically update every time there is an assignment change. If significant
changes have been made and the tables need to be updated the user can click
the [Update Table] button to force a refresh.

The [Show Peaks] and [Show Resonances] buttons can be used to display all of
the peaks and resonances, in tabular form, from which the information in the
selected rows are derived. These options are not available for the first tab.

Lots of red warnings in the "Resonances" tab, especially in in the "Bound"
column, may be an indication of a problem with the specification of one or
more experiment types, rather than a direct problem with the peak assignments.
Knowledge of which experimental dimensions represent 'onebond' transfers, by
virtue of peak assignment, indicates which atomic assignments are in a
covalent bond context. The most common mistakes in this regard are the
incorrect choice of experiment type or an incorrect choice of dimension order
(i.e. how the real experiment dimensions map to the CCPN reference). Both of
these problems may be fixed by considering the "Experiment Types" tab in the
Experiments_ popup window. Here, most dimension order problems are fixed by
editing the "Transfers To Dim" column in the lower left table, using the
user's knowledge of how the dimensions are connected/correlated.
