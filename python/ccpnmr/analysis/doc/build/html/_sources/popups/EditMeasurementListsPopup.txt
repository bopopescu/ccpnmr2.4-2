**The NMR Derived Measurements and Their Lists**

The purpose of this popup window is to display lists of measurements within
the current CCPN project. A "Measurement" in this regard is a value that is
derived from NMR data and connects to one or more resonances (which may be
assigned to atoms). The most commonly encountered kind of measurement is the
chemical shift, which is usually derived from recording the positions of peaks
in spectra. In this instance the chemical shift measurement of a resonance is
made when it is assigned to the dimension of a peak. Because CCPN allows
multiple shift lists (technically a type of measurement list) a resonance may
have a several chemical shift measurements; useful studying different
conditions.

There are several different kinds of measurement and hence measurement list that
may be included within a CCPN project, for example J-coupling, hydrogen
exchange rate, chemical shift anisotropy, T1 relaxation and chemical shift.
All types will be displayed by this popup if they are available within the
current project, although Analysis does not necessarily have tools to record
all of these different kinds of measurement.

The layout of this popup consists of two tabs, one for the organising lists
that contain the measurements and another to display the individual
measurements within a single list. With the exception of blank
lists for chemical shifts, measurement lists are not made using this popup,
instead they are made at the point where an analysis is performed, e.g. T1
lists are made with data from the `Follow Intensity Changes`_
tool.

The second tab, containing the "Measurements" table displays the details of
the individual measured values within a selected list. What the values mean
and which units they are in, if any, naturally depends on the kind of list
being viewed. If measurements are made within CCPN software (as opposed to
being imported) then the individual measurements usually record the spectrum
peaks that were used in the calculation of the measured value, e.g. the peaks
for which positions record chemical shift or intensities record T1.

**Caveats & Tips**

If there is no chemical shift list within a project a new one will be made
automatically to record the shifts of any assignments.

The shift list with which an experiment is associate may be changed via the "Shift
List" column of the main `Experiments`_ table.

Measurements other than chemical shift, like T1 and T2 relaxation times will only
appear within this system if a measurement list entity is formally made. Simply
measuring values from spectra, for example using the `Follow Intensity Changes`_
tool

|button| **Show Peaks**: Show a table containing peaks that were used to derive the selected measurements

|button| **Recalculate**: For some measurement lists (currently only shift lists) manually trigger a recalculation of values

|button| **Show Resonances**: Show a table containing the resonances that relate to the selected measurements

|button| **Delete**: Delete the selected measurement records; cannot be done for chemical shift values still ties to peaks via assignment
