**Find and Link Sequentially Related Protein Backbone Assignments**

This popup window is designed to expedite the process of sequentially
assigning a polypeptide backbone. The tool is semi-automated, in that
possibilities for sequentially related peaks and spin systems are
automatically found and presented, but it is still up to the user to determine
which are really sequentially linked. Likewise, the tool will show where a
sequential stretch of assignments best fits with a molecular sequence, but its
is the users' decision to commit the final choice. A fully automated tool is
available using the `Automated Seq. Assignment`_ option, although this is best
suited to relatively complete and clean data sets.

This system works with pairs of spectra where one spectrum has peaks that are
through-carbonyl specific; to show the previous (i-1) residue relative to the
amide (like with HNcoCA/CB), the other spectrum is non-specific in that it
shows both peaks for the amides current residue (i) and the previous residue
in the chain (i-1) (link with HNCA/CB). The general principle is that the
combination of the carbonyl-specific and non-specific experiment enables
identification of the resonances for the current residue and the residue one
previous in the sequence. The sequential assignment is made by finding amide
locations where the "current residue" resonances of one (hopefully
unambiguously) match the "previous residue" resonances of another. Fitting of
chains of amides linked in this way to the molecular sequence, by considering
chemical shift values, then gives the final residue assignment.

For any of the spectra to be used by this system they must be peak picked and
corresponding positions must be linked to the relevant spin system and
resonance assignments, albeit in an anonymous way. This setup is readily
achieved by the `Pick & Assign From Roots`_ option. The peaks of different
spectra that relate to the  same amide are only known to be from the same
amide because of assignment. Several different kinds of spectra may be used,
including those that detect 13C resonances (like HNCO, HNcaCO, HNcoCA, HNCA
etc) and those that detect 1H resonances (like HNcocaHA, HNHA, etc). This tool
can match multiple types of spectra at the same time to improve the assignment
process, for example matching HA, CO, CA and CB positions to minimise
ambiguity. However, the spectra that are involved with matching 1H positions
are naturally displayed in a different spectrum window to those using 13C
positions.

**User Operation**

To perform the sequence assignment the user first selects spectra, and
spectrum windows to display them in, categorising them as "query"; selecting
in the upper panel, or "match"; selecting in the lower panel (toggling the
"Use?" column). The "query" spectra are those that remain at a set position
according to a selected amide. The "match" spectra are those that the query
peaks are compared against and represent the, potentially multiple, positions
of candidates for amides that might be sequence neighbours to the query. Query
spectra can be of through-carbonyl types (e.g, HNcoCA), in which case matches
represent the preceding residue in the sequence (an i to i-1 step), or the
query spectra can be non-specific, where the matches will be to the following
residue in the sequence (i to i+1). When making sequential links the tool
automatically knows which sequence direction to make links with.

The "Options" tab may be viewed to control how the matching of peaks works,
but the default values will be acceptable in most instances. Most options
control how the spectrum window strip regions are made and displayed.
Occasionally it may be useful to consider the "Filter By Inter/Intra Type"
options. By default matches between "previous residue" peaks and other
"previous residue" peaks from different amides are discarded. However, if a
"current residue" peak overlaps with a "previous residue" peak for the same
amide (e.g. very similar 13C positions) then the default rule may miss a
legitimate match. Toggling the "Filter By Inter/Intra Type" option off will
allow positions with such overlap to be successfully matched, although this may
increase the number of spurious matches and add ambiguity.

The actual sequential assignment is performed in the "Spin System Table" tab.
The general idea is that the user selects a spin system row, whereupon the
query window navigates to the amide position of that row and the  match window
displays all of the other amide positions, in as many strips as required,
that have the relevant matches to at least some of the query peaks. The
identity of the potential sequential matches is also listed in the middle
"Matched Peak Positions" table. In this table the user may discard certain
amide positions/strips from consideration, but the objective is to select one
match position that represents a real sequential neighbour. If such a choice
can be made [Set Seq Link] sets the appropriate connection between the query
and matched amide spin systems. Not that this is merely a statement of
sequence relationship, no residue assignment will be made unless one of the
amides is assigned, whereupon the assignment will spread along the chain in
the appropriate direction.

Once the user has connected sufficient spin systems into regions of sequential
connectivity  (visible in the "i+1" and "i-1" columns) the next task is to
associate the linked but unassigned amides with particular residues. Full
residue assignment is made by selecting a region of sequence in the lower left
"Sequence Locations" table and clicking [Assign Selected]. This table and the
"Residue Types" table to the right are designed to show you how the amides may
fit into the residue sequence. The right hand table shows the probable residue
types for the query amide, based upon the chemical shifts in the spin system
(use [Predict Type] to see details of the prediction for the current spin
system), and any sequentially linked neighbours. The left hand table shows
where in the sequence the stretch of sequentially linked amides best fits,
according to residue type predictions. Those residues that have already been
assigned are coloured blue.

**Caveats & Tips**

When working with multiple polypeptide chains, make sure the correct one is
selected in the "options" tab to give the right sequence.

The peak-peak match tolerance is set on a per-spectrum basis (for the relevant
dimension) in the "Tolerance" columns of the "Windows and Spectra" tab. Note
that this is actually the same attribute as the regular peak assignment
tolerance.

It should be noted that mixing of carbonyl-specific and non-specific in the
query or match spectra is not permitted; otherwise it is not clear in which
direction the sequential linking is made.

The ability to use spectra that match in a 15N dimension, e.g. HNcaN, HNcoCAN
will be added in due course.
