**Display Protein Backbone Phi & Psi Angles**

This graphical display allow the user to display phi and psi protein backbone
dihedral angles on a Ramachandran plot that indicates the likelihood (database
abundance) of those angles. This can be used as a form of structure quality
control to detect residues in a calculated three dimensional structure that
are distorted away from regular protein-like conformations. Although a few
atypical angles may truly occur in a given protein structure the presence of
many unusual angles and abnormal distributions of angles over a structure
ensemble with many models may indicate a poor quality structure.

With this popup window the user selects a molecular system and then a
structure ensemble that relates to that system. Th e user can choose to display
dihedral angle information for all models (conformations) in the structure ensemble
or just one model, by changing the "Model" pulldown menu. The user can control which
residues are considered by selecting either a particular type of residue via
"Ccp Code" or a specific residue in the sequence. Other options control how the
phi & psi angle information is presented on screen. The "Labels" options
control which angle spots on the Ramachandran chart have residue sequence number and
type displayed; by default only the "disallowed" angles in unusual (white) regions of the
plot are labelled. The "Spot Size" dictates how large the angle markers are and
the "Colours" is a colour scheme to differentiate the different models
from within the selected ensemble.

The [Previous Residue] and [Next Residue] buttons allow the user to quickly
scan though all of the residues in the structure, to check for
unusual/disallowed backbone angles or unlikely distributions of within the
ensemble. In the Ramachandran matrix plot the wite areas represent phi & psi
angle combinations that are very unusual and thus usually indicative of a poor
structure at that point. The grey and red areas represent the more common, and
thus more expected, angle combinations. The more red the colour of a square
the greater the likelihood of the phi & psi angles. It should be noted that
when displaying angle points for only a single residue or residue type, the
Ramachandran chart in the background is at  residue-specific version, i.e. it
shows angle likelihoods for only that one kind of residue. This is particularly
important for Pro and Gly residues that have notably different distributions
(and hence angle expectations) to other residues.
