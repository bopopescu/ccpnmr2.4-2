**Edit Position, Intensity & Details for a Peak**

This popup window provides an means of editing peak information as an
alternative to editing values in the main peak tables. This popup is also used
to specify parameters for when a new peak is explicitly added to a peak list
using a tabular display.

The user can specify the position of the peak's dimensions in ppm, Hz or data
point units. Also, the user can adjust the height and volume peak intensity
values and a textual "Details" field, ,which can carry the user's comments
about the peak.

When editing an existing peak, no changes are made to the peak until the
[Update] button is pressed. Likewise for a new peak the [Add Peak] button
commits the changes. If the popup window is closed before the changes are
committed then the entire editing or peak addition operation is cancelled.
