**Spectrum Window Contour Display**

The spectrum display in Analysis displays NMR spectra of arbitrary
dimensionality and allows the user to identify signal peaks and assign them
to atomic resonances. A CCPN project may contain as many spectrum windows as
memory allows with whichever axis types the user requires.

Simple 1-dimensional spectra are displayed as intensity graphs, but higher
dimensionality spectra are displayed as contour plots. A contour plot
represents the intensities in the plane of an NMR spectrum and each contour
line represents points of equal data value (height). For a 2-dimensional
spectrum there is only one displayable spectrum plane, but for 3D and higher
there are many planes, which can be imagined as being stacked on top of one
another along depth axes. The user can navigate to view any  position in a
spectrum by changing the region of the plane displayed in the screen and
independently adjust what the current depth position is. Also, in windows with
depth axes Analysis has the ability to display several planes at once in a
specified depth region, i.e. a given thickness. A spectrum window always has
the same kind of spectrum dimensions (e.g. in terms of isotope) represented
by the on-screen (X,Y) and depth (Z) axes. If an alternative, orthogonal view
is required, for example to show different NMR axes in the plane of the
screen then a new window must be made. However, if the user  simply wishes to
swap spectrum data axes that have the *same* kind of isotope then this can be
done without having to make a new window; the mapping of spectra into windows
can be adjusted via the "Spectrum & Peak List Mappings" section of the main
`Windows`_ option.

There are three basic components to a spectrum window popup: there is the
main graphical spectrum display with axes and scrollbars, which may be
sub-divided into several strips/panels; a toolbar of buttons at the top,
which control what is displayed in the window; and also a menu accessible
with a right mouse click over the main display, which has a large amount of
important functionality.

**Top Toolbar**

The toolbar of buttons above the main spectrum display area allows the user
to control various aspects of what is displayed. After clicking on one of the
top buttons an extra panel will appear to give access to further options, and
clicking on the same top button again will make the options panel disappear.

*Spectra*

The [Spectra] option allows the user to toggle individual spectra within the
main display on or off. The spectra that can be displayed are naturally
those that have the right kinds of isotopes on their axes for the spectrum
window. Although, a spectrum may be displayed at least the X & Y axes match,
i.e. a 2D spectrum can be displayed in the X-Y plane of a 3D window. Spectra
may be prevented from appearing within this toolbar, to avoid overcrowding,
by changing the "Spectrum In Toolbar" column within the "Spectrum & Peak List
Mappings" section of the main `Windows`_ option.

Spectra may also be toggled on an off using keyboard shortcuts, which are set
in the main `Spectra`_ display options. Also, the order in which spectra
are drawn is reflected in the order that they appear in the top panel;
this is set via the "Rank" of the `Spectra`_ display options.

*Contours*

The [Contours] option allows the user to adjust the contour base level (green
arrows), the number of contour lines and flip between positive and negative
levels. These settings will be applied to *all of the visible spectra* in
the window. Hence, it is common for the user to toggle certain spectra off
first if they should not be affected. These contour settings are fairly
simple, but more detailed control of contours is given by the [More..]
button which opens the main `Spectrum Contour Levels`_ popup.

*Peaks*

The [Peaks] option allows the user to control which peak lists, in terms of
the peak markers and annotations, will be visible in the main graphical
display. The user simply clicks on the button of a peak list to turn it on or
off. By default the "Multi-list" option is set so that any number of peak
list will be displayed, otherwise the user can uncheck this so that only one
peak list is shown at a time. Having only one peak list shown is useful to
avoid picking peaks in the wrong spectra; peaks will only be picked in
displayed peak lists.

It should be noted that when a spectrum has more than one peak list only one
of these will be active; the active peak list is the one that the user can
select in the spectrum and the one newly picked signal maxima are placed in.
To change the active peak list for a spectrum and how peak lists are shown
(symbol type and colour) the user should edit the main `Peak Lists`_ table.

*Strips*

The [Strips] option controls how the graphical spectrum display is
sub-divided. These sub-divisions are called "strips" and allow the user to
have different panels in the window showing different regions on the spectra.
All strips will be tied together along one axis; with vertical strips the
Y-axis is the same for all sub-divisions, and for horizontal strips the
X-axis is common. Strips can be added and removed by the user, although
many systems in Analysis will automatically curate strips (e.g, for protein
sequence assignment). The strips' panel also indicates which
strip in the window is deemed to be active (its button will be green);
it is the active strip that can be moved with the green arrow and is
the target of any navigation options into the window.

Spectrum windows in Analysis have another way of defining sub-divisions which
are called "separators". These are distinct from strips and are not generally
administered from the toolbar (except the ability to remove them all). A
separator is a sub-division that goes at right angles to the main strip
divisions and serves to split the axis which is not affected by the strips.
For example a window with vertical strips can have horizontal separators
which split the Y-axis into separate regions to display separate PPM ranges
(e.g. CA, CB, C'). Separators may be added via the right mouse `Window
Menu`_.

*Coordinate Location*

The last button in the top toolbar displays the current location of the mouse
cursor for the window. Clicking on the button  opens the `Center
coordinates`_ panel which  allows the user to specify a particular location
for the center of the window view and also allows the cursor location to be
displayed in Hz units, rather than PPM.

**Spectrum Display Area**

The main graphical display area is where spectrum lines, contours and peak
markers are displayed. At the edge of the area are tick axes with numbers
indicating the display region (usually in PPM). The display region may be
changed by using the scrollbars or the various mouse controls listed below.
Note that the scrollbars may be removed to save space using the right mouse
`Window Menu`_.  The box at the bottom right corner where the tick axes meet
shows the position of the current view, according to zoom level and
position, relative to the maximum possible extent of the window axes.

For 3D and higher dimensionality windows there will be extra scrollbars at
the bottom representing the depth axes. The current position of these is
displayed to the left of the scrollbar, and this may be set by typing in the
entry box. These depth (or "orthogonal") scrollbars are different to the X-Y
scrollbars because they also control the thickness of the depth view (i.e.
the number of planes deep to show contours for). To change the thickness of a
view the left or right edge of the depth slider can be expanded or shrunk
using the middle mouse button.

*Window Navigation*

The cursor may change the region of the spectrum (or spectra) displayed in
the graphical area by using both keyboard and mouse controls that allow the
view to pan, zoom and change orthogonal depth position. These controls are
summarised as follows, noting that the middle mouse button is specialised
for these functions:

:Pan Window: Arrow keys
             Middle-click + drag

:Zoom In/Out: <PageDown>/<PageDown>
              Scroll wheel forward/back
              <Shift> + Middle-click + drag up/down

:Zoom To Region: <Control> + Middle-click + drag region

:Depth Scroll: <Control> + scroll wheel forward/back
               <Shift> + scroll wheel forward/back

*Peak Picking*

The intensity maxima and minima in NMR spectra which represent the locations
of resonance signals may be marked as being a peak, i.e. "picked". Picked
peaks are marked with crosses at their centre and carry an assignment
annotation to indicate the resonances from which the peak derives. For an
unassigned peak this annotation will just be dashes (one for each spectrum
dimension).

Spectrum peaks may be picked in three basic ways in Analysis: by specifying
an exact peak location with the mouse, by dragging a rectangular peak-find
region with the mouse to find extrema, and by using the "Region Peak Find"
functionality of the `Peak Finding`_ section to find extrema in a large
spectrum region. In all cases newly picked peaks are placed in the active
peak list for a given spectrum (set in the `Peak Lists` popup). The mouse
and keyboard controls used to pick peaks are listed below, noting that the
<Control> key and left mouse button are specialised for this purpose:

:Pick Peak at Mouse Position: <Control> + left-click

:Peak Peaks in Region: <Control> + <shift> + left-click & drag

It should be noted that when peaks are picked all visible spectra are
considered for picking, but only if their active peak list is toggled on (via
the top tab). By default, if an exact peak position is specified then new
peaks will be picked in all visible spectra. Similarly, when dragging a box
to find intensity minima/maxima in a region, peaks are picked for the extrema
found in all visible spectra. If the user wants to avoid picking peaks in
specific spectra then a spectrum can be toggled off in the top panel, or the
active peak list for the spectrum can be toggled off (leaving any contours
visible). For the region search peaks will be located according to the "Find
Parameters" set in the `Peak Finding`_ popup; by default extrema are only
found above the same threshold that contours are displayed for.

Note that if a spectrum is tiled so that its contours are visible outside the
normal bounds any peak picked in a tiled region will be picked at the
apparent PPM value; the peak is recorded internally at the equivalent
position inside the spectrum, but its position is automatically "unaliased"
to move it outside the spectrum width. Here the underlying, aliased peak
inside the spectrum width will also be displayed, albeit with a dashed cross.

*Peak Selection*

Specific visible peaks may be selected to that specific operations may be
performed on them (assign, delete...). Peaks that have been selected are
displayed with a solid box around their marker crosses. Peaks can be selected
in several different spectra and in several different windows, even if the
peak locations are not currently visible; so caution should be used when
deleting peaks. Beak selections can be defined and added to according to the
mouse controls listed below, noting common use of the left mouse button.
Also, a number of operations may be performed on the selected peak(s) by
using keyboard shortcuts.

:Select Single Peak: Left-click at center

:Select Several Peaks: Left-click & drag box over peaks

:Add Single Peak To Selection: <Shift> + Left-click

:Add Several Peaks To Selection: <Shift> + Left-click & drag box over peaks

:Clear Peak Selection: Left-click in a region without peaks

:Move Selected Peak: <p> + drag mouse

:Re-center Selected Peaks: <P>

:Assign Peak Under Mouse: <a> (opens `Assignment Panel`)

:Show Selected Peaks Table: <s> (opens `Selected Peaks`)

:Delete Selected Peaks: <Delete>

:Move Selected Peaks Label: <q> + drag mouse

Note that the keyboard shortcuts listed are the default settings
and could actually be different. All keyboard shortcuts are listed
(and can be changed) in the "Macros" section of the `User Options`_
popup.

*Marker Lines & Rulers*

The user may place dashed, multi-dimensional marker lines (i.e. a big cross)
at the current mouse location using <m>. Also a 1-dimensional dashed ruler
line may be placed at the mouse location using <h> for a horizontal line and
<v> for a vertical line. Any multi-dimensional mark that is suitably close to
a peak will automatically lock on to the exact peak location. The <n> key is
used to remove all marks and rulers.

For a detailed description of marker lines and rulers and their various
options see the `Marks and Rulers`_ documentation.

*1D Traces*

An spectrum window can additionally carry a number of 1-dimensional (i.e.
intensity graph) slice traces, which show a cross section through the
displayed spectra at the current mouse location. Such slice traces may be
added via the right mouse menu "Window" option, selection either crosshair
traces that are superimposed in the main graphical display or side traces
that are shown as extra panels to the side of the window.

**Right Mouse Menu**

The right mouse button, when pressed over the graphical display area, will
open up a menu that allow the user to perform various operations. These
functions are sub-divided into  the main categories listed below. For more
detailed descriptions see the `Window Menu`_ section.

*Assign*

These options control the assignment of the selected peak or peaks to
resonances and spin systems (intra residue groups). For example the user can
assign a peak, propagate (spread) assignments over several peaks, remove
assignments etc.

*Peak*

These options relate to general operations performed on peaks, including
deletion, setting aliasing, setting details and arranging labels. Many of
these functions have keyboard shortcuts (see "Macros" section of the `User
Options`_).

*Locate Peaks*

These functions are used to find the selected peaks in the spectrum window or
use the locations of peaks to navigate to matching peaks (or equivalent
positions). Some of these options include navigation to other windows.

*View*

The view functions control the current spectrum region being
displayed and the contour levels.

*Navigate*

The navigation options allow the user to locate equivalent positions in other
spectrum windows based upon the mouse location. Such locations are found in
windows that have at least some of the same kinds of axes as the current
window. For example the user may navigate from a 2D HN window displaying an
HSQC spectrum to the equivalent HN (amide) position in a 3D window.

*Strip*

These options are used to control strips and separators; the two kinds
of spectrum window sub-division.

*Markers*

The marker options control the presence of dashed position marker lines;
both  multi-dimensional markers and 1-dimensional rulers.

*Window*

This section provides various general functions for the spectrum window which
include: making a duplicate "clone" of a window, printing a window to file
(e.g. PDF) and controlling the 1D slice traces.

*Macros*

This menu contains lists any Python macro scripts that have been added to
Analysis (see `User Options`_) to operate in the context of a spectrum
window.
