**Register User with CCPN**

The purpose of this dialog is to allow the user to register with CCPN.
This is mainly to allow CCPN to keep track of the number of users,
which is important for grant applications.  This information is saved
both in a file on your computer but also in a private CCPN server
database if your computer is connected to the internet.  (So unfortunately
you will need to register once for each computer you use.)

The required information: the user name, organisation and email address.
The other information stored on the CCPN server: the version number, the
first time and most recent time the server has been notifed.

If you are registered, then the server is notified every time a project is
opened or saved (if connected to the internet).

Click "Register Now" to register, or "Register Later" not to register.
