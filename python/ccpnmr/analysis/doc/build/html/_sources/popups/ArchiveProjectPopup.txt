**Archive the Project**

This popup window enables the user to archive the CCPN Project into a gzipped
tar file.  By default it only includes the *.xml files which reside in the
project directory.  If the "Include *.xml.bak files" check button is checked
then it will also include the *.xml.bak files which reside in the project
directory.  If the "Include data files which are in the project directory"
check button is checked then it will also include the binary data files
which reside in the project directory.

**Caveats & Tips**

The archive excludes the reference data *.xml files (quite sensibly).
