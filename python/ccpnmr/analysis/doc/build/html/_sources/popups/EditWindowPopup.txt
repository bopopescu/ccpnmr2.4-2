**Edit Spectrum Window Parameters**

This popup window controls all of the settings that relate to the spectrum
display windows used in Analysis. All of the spectrum windows within the
project are listed and all of the details which control how they show spectra
and peak lists are given, and in many cases the parameters can be edited. The
settings available in this popup are often also, and sometimes more commonly,
manipulated elsewhere. For example, the toggle buttons at the top of spectrum
windows are usually used to control spectrum and peak list visibility.
However, this popup window provides an authoritative list of all relevant
settings, including a few that are not accessible from elsewhere.

The layout of the popup is divided into three tabs; the first lists the main
properties of the spectrum windows and their axis, the second controls how
spectra and peak lists are mapped into the windows and displayed, and the
third allows the user to group windows together so that different sets may be
reserved for different kinds of operation.

**Windows & Axes**

The first tab is divided into two sections. The upper table lists the spectrum
windows which have been defined in the current CCPN project or, if the "Active
windows" options is set, those in the active window group. The settings given
in the table, which may all be edited, relate to general properties that
govern the whole window display. Typically user may change the name of a
window and adjust the aspect ratio; all spectrum window displays in Analysis
preserve aspect ratio when zooming, so peaks remain the same aesthetic shape.
The crosshair trace settings control whether a 1D intensity slice is
superimposed upon the cursor location, although this is normally toggled on or
off via the right-click mouse menu of the particular spectrum window. For both
the spectrum traces that appear at the crosshair location and those that may
be added to side panels (at the window's edge) the "Slice Range" column
dictates the scale that is used to show the intensity axis. In normal
operation the user controls this with the <PgUp> and <PgDn> keys, rather than
via this table. The last two columns of the table indicate whether strip
numbers and Z axis positions are superimposed on the spectrum display (in the
corners).

The lower table lists the kinds of axes are present in the selected window;
the selected row in the upper table. Here the user can control whether a
scrollbar to move window contents appears or not, e.g. to save some screen
space. The "Panel Type" column is used to make sub-groups of window axes that
otherwise have the same isotope type. The panel type definitions are set
elsewhere, in the Axes_ popup. The panel type is only relevant for dictating
where 1D ruler lines go in different windows; a ruler is only displayed on
axes with the same panel type, thus the user can distinguish amide 1H axes
(panel type "H1") and other 1H axes (panel type "H2"). The last two columns
adjust the depth and presence of the "Side Trace". When visible, a side trace
shows a 1D intensity graph at the edge of the window axis. Naturally, this
only applies for the X & Y screen dimensions.

**Spectrum & Peak List Mappings**

The second tab controls how spectra and peak lists are displayed within the
spectrum window selected at the top. It should be noted that spectrum contour levels and
colours are set elsewhere, via the main Spectra_ popup. Likewise, the peak
list symbols and colours are changed in the `Peak Lists`_ popup. These
peaklist and spectrum settings are set on a project-wide basis, and thus are
not set for an individual display window.

The upper table lists all of the spectra that may be displayed in the selected
spectrum window. Here the user can control: whether a spectrum is listed in
the  toolbar at the top of the window, where spectra are switched on and off;
whether the positive contours are drawn; whether the negative contours are
drawn; and whether the 1D intensity slices, when used, include the spectrum.
The last "Dim. Mapping" column is important if the user wishes to change how
the data dimensions of a spectrum are mapped to the X, y & Z axes of the
spectrum window, especially given that Analysis cannot always guess this
correctly when there are two axis with the same isotope type. If, for example,
the user has a 3D HC_cH.TOCSY spectrum and the first 1H data dimension (from
the spectrum file) is displayed on the X axis, when it should really be on the
Z axis, then the user clicks on the "Dim. Mapping" column. In the resulting
mini-popup, changing the "Dimension 1" pulldown menu from "x" to "z1" will
correct the axis mapping and effectively rotate the spectrum data as far as
the window view is concerned. It should be noted that multiple windows may
need to be adjusted in this way for any given spectrum; only the user can
really decide what is correct, especially where data axes have been swapped.

The lower "Mapped Peak Lists" table shows all of the peak lists that may be
displayed in the selected spectrum window. In the display sense, a peak list
consists of a list of peak symbols (i.e. positioned crosses) and assignment
annotations. The two columns of the table that can be edited dictate whether a
peak list's peak symbols and annotations are drawn, thus giving total control.
However, these settings are usually controlled via the toolbar at the top of a
spectrum window, and normally the peak symbols and textual annotations are both
switched on or off at the same time.

**Window Groups**

Defining window groups is a mechanism by which different selections of
spectrum windows may be made so that only some are visible at the same time.
There will only be one active group of spectrum windows at a given time, and
only those in this active group can be opened and will be shown in the main
Analysis menu. The user can create as many named window groupings as is
required and can add any window to any group. Clicking on a group in the upper
table lists all of the windows in the project and whether they are included in
the selected group or not. To add a window to a group, or remove it from a
group, the user simply toggles the "In Group?" column. The selected group may
be set as the active one by clicking on the central [Make Active] button.
