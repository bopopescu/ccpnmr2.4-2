**A Table of Resonances Organised by Chemical Shift List**

This popup window is basically a table of all the resonances that have
chemical shifts contained within a selected shift list. This data, in-keeping
with the CCPN Resonance entities it represents, serves as the central record
that ties atom assignments to peak assignments. An individual resonance many
be anonymous and not (yet) carry an atomic assignment but still exists as an
entity that carries a chemical shift record and connections to peaks in
spectra. Each resonance row in the table may be considered as a "phenomenon
number" that may be used to connect various things together when assignments
are made. Within a given shift list each resonance will one have only one
chemical shift value, but a resonance may have different chemical shift values
in separate shift lists, for example corresponding to different conditions;
where the resonance phenomenon is the same (from the same atom) but its
position in spectra changes.

The resonance table serves both as a source of information in its own right
and a means of finding information related to a given set of assignments. For
example the user may wish to sort the resonances according to residue sequence
(click on the "Residue" heading), scroll to and select the desired residue and
then [Show All Peaks] that are associated with the residue assignment. In
normal operation the user selects the appropriate shift list (e.g. for the set
of conditions) and any isotope, status or molecular subset to fill the table
with a series of resonance records. Each resonance is shown with its chemical
shift value, any atomic or residue assignment, isotope type and various other
useful information. From the table, operations may be performed on a selected
subset of resonances by selecting the relevant row; left click +/-
<Ctrl>/<Shift>, and then clicking on the buttons.

**Navigation**

The upper "Navigation & Marks" section allows the user to display resonance
positions in the spectrum windows. The user can build strips (sub-divisions)
with the selected resonance positions (e.g. selecting H & N amide resonances),
center the contour display and create marker lines at the locations. Although
similar functionality is also available from the peak table, the user cam get
more flexible control by selecting resonances, for example to navigate to a
location in a spectrum where a peak is *expected*, but has not been picked. It
should be noted that the [Strip Selected] and [Go To position] functions
operate on the spectrum window selected in the "Window" pulldown menu.

**Atom Assignment**

The penultimate row of buttons represent functions that change the atomic
assignment if the selected resonance (or resonances, depending on the
operation). Accordingly, a resonance may be disconnected from atoms, linked to
atoms, given an atom type (e.g. a general "HA") and added to or removed from a
spin system; a group of resonances belonging to a residue. The last two options
relate only to resonances that are deemed to be prochiral, for example like
Ser HB2/HB3, which often cannot be distinguished until the latter stages of 3D
structure calculation.

**General & Information**

The lower row of buttons relate to functions that do not involve atom
assignment. For example resonances may be deleted; either those that are
selected or those that are considered to be "orphans" - without any current
assignments to spectrum peaks. The two "Show Peaks" buttons display tables  of
the spectrum peaks that are currently linked to the selected resonances,
optionally considering only spectra that use the selected shift list. The last
[Info] button opens the `Resonance Info`_ table for the last selected
resonance to display the positions of all the peak dimensions to which it is
assigned and all its chemical shift values, from multiple shift lists.

**Caveats & Tips**

The [Delete Orphans] function is commonly used to tidy up projects where there
are large numbers of resonances that are no longer assigned to any peaks. This
may occur for example resonances have been automatically added to newly picked
peaks but once assignment is complete many of the resonances turned out to  be
duplicate, e.g. separate resonances were initially added to HNCA and HNcoCA
peaks even though the resonances should be shared.

If a resonance has a large standard deviation in its chemical shift use the
[Info] button to show the peak dimension positions that formed the chemical
shift average.

If the list of resonances in the table is too large to easily find a
particular resonance, consider using the filtering selections at the top or
click the "?" in the table headings to filter directly on table content.
