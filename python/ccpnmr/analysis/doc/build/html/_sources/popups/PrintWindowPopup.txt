**Print Window to Output File**

The purpose of this dialog is to allow the saving of the drawing of
one of the spectrum windows to a file, in one of the following formats:
PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) or Portable Document
Format (PDF).

The one window that is being printed out is specified at the top.
There are four tabs.  The first one, Options, is the most important.
In particular, it is used to specify the File name.  At its simplest
to print out a window you just need to specify the File name, and
then click "Save Print File".  But it is likely you will at the very
least want to change some of the settings in the Options tab.

You can specify a Title and a label for the X axis and/or Y axis.

This tab is also used to specify the Paper size (default A4), the
Orientation of the paper (default Portrait), whether the printout
is Color or Black and white (the Style, default Color), and what
the Format is (PS, EPS or PDF, default PS).

The ticks for the rulers can be chosen to be Inside or Outside the
main frame and can be in any combination of the Top, Bottom, Left
or Right side of the main frame.  The Tick Font includes the option
of not printing the tick labels at all.  The Tick spacing between
the major and minor ticks can be set automatically (so the program
determines it) or manually.  For the latter the user has to specify
the Major and Minor spacings in terms of the unit of the display
(normally ppm), and also the number of decimal places for the Tick
labels.

How the main frame fits into the paper is determined by the Scaling
option.  The Percentage option just means that the main frame is
scaled by that amount relative to the biggest size it could be and
still fit on the paper.  The remaining options are if you want to
specify the cms or inches per unit (normally ppm), or the inverse
of these.  In this case it could be the case that the main frame
actually exceeds the size of the paper.

You can also include the Time and Date and/or the File Name in the
printout, and you can specify the font used for this.  The same
font is used for the Title and X and Y axis labels, except that
the Title font is 6 pts bigger.

Finally, you can also set the linewidth, in points (the default is 0.1).

The other three tabs provide fine tuning of what is output.  In many
cases they can be ignored.

The Spectra tab lets you choose settings for which of the window's
spectra are drawn, in terms of both the positive and negative contours.
This is independent of what is actually drawn on the screen.  But you
need to check the "Use below settings when printing" checkbutton if you
want the values specified here to be used rather than the screen settings.
The values in the table are initially set to be the screen values but
afterwards can only be changed manually.  Clicking on the "Reset Selected"
button changes the values in the table to the current screen ones.

The Peak Lists tab is similar, except it applies to the peak lists in
the window rather than the spectra.  Again, if you want the values in
the table to be used then you need to check the "Use below settings
when printing" checkbutton.

The Region tab is for specifying the region for the x, y and orthogonal
axes, if you do not want to use the regions as seen in the window on the
screen.  Again, you have to check "Use override region when printing"
checkbutton to actually have the values in the table be used in the
printout.  By default, the override region is set to the current
window region if it is not set already, otherwise it is left to the
previous value unless you click the "Set Region from Window" or the
"Set Width from Window" or the "Set Center from Window" buttons.
And the override region can be specified either using the min and max
values of the region, or the center and width.
