**Setup Spectrum Marker and Ruler Line Options**

This popup window is used to specify how many marker and ruler lines may
be added by the user to spectrum windows, and what colours these will be.

A marker line is a multi-dimensional cross mark that is typically added to
the spectrum display with the "m" key, using the mouse cursor location as
the center point. A mark of this kind gives a cross that is displayed on a
spectrum window (in the plane of the screen), although the same lines will
be visible in other spectra that show the relevant frequency/ppm range. A
mark will also place lines in any orthogonal (z) positions of the spectrum
view; these will not be visible in the window to which the mark was first
added but will be seen in any windows that show orthogonal view views of
the marked point.

A ruler is a single line that is added to the spectrum window displays,
typically using the "h" key for a horizontal line and the "v" key for a
vertical line. A ruler only places a single line in the plane of the
screen at the mouse cursor location. A ruler may be visible in more than
one spectrum window, but only if the view is in the right range and for
axes that share the same "Panel Type"; a sub-division of axis types that
are otherwise specified in terms of isotope. The panel type for a window
axis is set via the main Windows_ table.

This system allows the user to specify the maximum number of marks and
rulers that may be displayed on the screen at any one time. It should be
noted that this setting only applies to marks and rulers that are directly
added by the user, others may be added by various tools throughout
Analysis. When adding marks or rulers to a spectrum window, if the limit
is reached then adding another will remove the oldest mark/ruler.
Naturally, if the limit is set to one, then the mark or ruler is always
replaced. By decreasing the maximum limit the oldest will be removed,
although the usual way of removing (all) marks and rulers is via the "n"
key after clicking in a spectrum window.

Marks and rulers that are added by the user may use a colour scheme, such
that each subsequent addition uses the next colour from the scheme.
