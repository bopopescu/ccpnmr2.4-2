**Display Groups of Peaks Linked by a Root Assignment**

This popup window is used to display the results of operations in Analysis that
generate grouped peaks, usually linked by virtue of a common 'root' assignment.
For example a selected set of peaks may be macthed to other peaks with
similar positions in a spectrum dimension, where each group corresponds
to a separate C-H or N-H position. For example the right-click
window menu option "Locate Peaks::Match multiple peaks" generates
such groupings to find rows or columns of peaks that share chemical shifts.

Whatever operation generated the groups, they are listed in ranked order in the
table; best scoring at the top. The number of peaks in the group and any common
assigment and position is also listed. The idea is that the groups are candidates
for some searh or macthing process that the user triggered. The best scoring
groups may be used to control the spectrum window display, thus displaying any
peak matches, by using [Display Groups in Strips] after selecting  an approprate
window. This system is often used for NOESY experiments where resonances that are
close in space share common sets of peak positions; they are close to the same
set of other resonances.

           *Rank*  The ranking of the peak group, comparing its score with others 
          *Score*  The match score of the peak group 
      *Num peaks*  Number of peaks within the matched peak group 
*Root Assignment*  The root (usually amide) assignment, common to peaks in a group 
    *F1 position*  Average location of the group in the F1 dimension
