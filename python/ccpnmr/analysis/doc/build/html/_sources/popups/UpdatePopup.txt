**Install Patches and Updates to CCPN Software**

This popup window allows the user to view and automatically install the
latest updates and patches to CcpNmr software. This is the normal mechanism
of receiving incremental changes and fixes to bug reports between numbered
CCPN releases. It should be noted that this system generally only provides
fixes for the most recent version of the CcpNmr Software. If your version is
older (but not as old as version 1.0) or if there has been a recent new
release then the updating mechanism will automatically upgrade the whole CCPN
distribution to the newest one. It should be noted that this mechanism will
not automatically update some of the really old versions, e.g. from version
1.0 to 2.0. Updates from 2.0 onwards ought to work seamlessly though.

In normal operation the user clicks [Select All] then [Install Selected],
whereupon the software should be restarted (not forgetting to save any data).
Naturally, viewing and receiving updates requires that the user's computer
has a working connection to the Internet. Although the user may toggle
individual file updates on or off by double-clicking in the "Install?" column,
it is generally not a good idea to choose only a subset of file updates unless
there is a specific reason to do so. Choosing only some file updates risks
getting problems where two or more files rely upon the most recent versions of
one another.

**Caveats & Tips**

Using [Refresh List] will cause the system to re-query the CCPN update server
if the user is awaiting an imminent fix.

When an updated file is installed the old version is not removed; it is renamed
with the "_old" suffix.

If for any reason this popup window cannot be opened the user may update the
software using the "updateAll" script that sits alongside the main "analysis"
program executable (usually in the $CCPN_HOME/bin/ directory).
