**Create Contour Files for Project**

The purpose of this dialog is to allow the user to create new contour
files for the project.  Not only the spectrum has to be specified, but
also the two dimensions (X, Y) that are going to be contoured.  The
table specifies the conditions that specify the region being contoured,
in terms of what is included and excluded.

For now, only one condition (which is an "include" condition) is allowed.
This also means that the "Add Condition" and "Delete Condition" buttons
are disabled.

The contour directory is specified by the program, using the project
directory but the file name can be specified by the user.

The contour levels used are the ones that are current for the spectrum,
as set in the `Contour Levels dialog`_.

See also: `Spectrum Contour Files`_, `Add Existing Contour Files`_.
