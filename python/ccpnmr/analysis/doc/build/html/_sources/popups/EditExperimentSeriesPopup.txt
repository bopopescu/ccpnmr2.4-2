**Setup Experiment Series for Chemical Shift and Intensity Changes**

The purpose of this popup is to setup ordered groups of experiments that are
related by the variation in some condition or parameter, but otherwise the
kind of experiment being run is the same. For example the user could setup
experiments for a temperature series, ligand binding titration or relaxation
rate measurement.

The layout is divided into two tables. The upper table shows all of the series
that are known to the current project and the lower table shows all of the
experiments or planes that comprise the selected series. These series relate
to both groups of separate experiments (and hence spectra) and also single
experiment where one dimension is not for NMR frequency but rather a "sampled"
dimension and thus effectively combines many experiments (e.g. for different
T1 values) as different planes. A stack of effectively 2D experiments combined
in this manner is typically referred to as pseudo-3D. - The experiment is 3D
but there are only two NMR dimensions.

Series which are stacks of planes in a single experiment entity are
automatically detected and entered into the table once they are loaded. Series
that are constructed from multiple, separate experiments however must be setup
by the user. To setup a new series of this kind [Add Series] makes a new,
empty NMR series. Next the user should change the "Parameter varied" column to
specify what type of thing is varied between the different experiments. The
user then adds experiments into this series with the [Add Series Point]
function at the bottom. Once the points have been added to the series the name
of the experiment for each point may be changed. Initially, arbitrary
experiments appear for the series points, so these almost always have to be
adjusted.

Once a stacked-plane experiment or series of experiments is setup, the user
next sets (or checks) the value of the parameter associated with each point in
the lower table. When loading stacked-plane experiments these values may come
though automatically, if they are present in the spectrum header or parameter
file. Given a completed NMR series specification the user may then extract the
relevant data from the series using one of the analysis tools like `Follow
Intensity Changes`_ or `Follow Shift Changes`_.

**Caveats & Tips**

Make sure the "Parameter Varied" for a given NMR series is appropriate to the
type of analysis being performed. Many tools that extract T1 or Kd
measurements for example look for specific types of series.

The "Set/Unset Ref Plane" function is only used in certain kinds of series
such as those that use trains of CPMG pulses.

**Table 1**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               *#*  The serial number of the experiment series, but left blank if the series as actually a pseudo-nD experiment (with a sampled non-frequency axis) 
            *Name*  The name of the experiment series, which may be a single pseudo-nD experiment  *(Editable)*
     *Experiments*  The number of separate experiments (and hence spectra) present in the series 
*Parameter Varied*  The kind of quantity that varies for different experiments/planes within the NMR series, e.g. delay time, temperature, ligand concentration etc.  *(Editable)*
      *Num Points*  The number of separate points, each with a separate experiment/plane and parameter value, in the series

|button| **Add Series**: Make a new, blank NMR series specification in the CCPN project

|button| **Delete Series**: Delete the selected NMR series from the project, although any component experiments remain. Note you cannot delete pseudo-nD series; delete the actual experiment instead

|button| **Auto Colour Spectra**: Colour the spectrum contours for each experiment in the selected series (not pseudo-nD) using a specified scheme

|pulldown| **Scheme**: Selects which colour scheme to apply to the contours of (separate) experiments within an NMR series
