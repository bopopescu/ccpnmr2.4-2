**Tabular Displays of Resonance Groups**

This popup window is used to display tables of the spin systems within a
project, from these the user can perform various residue-level assignment
and navigation operations and follow links to several kinds of relevant
information, like peak and resonance information. In CCPN parlance a "spin
system" is a grouping of resonances that relate to a residue or part
residue.  Typically in an assignment project you might start with a spin
system that consists only of amide 1H and 15N resonances and then add side
chain resonances like CA & HA. Such a grouping of resonances relates to the
atoms within a given residue, but the identity of the residue need not be
known before a spin system is generated. Accordingly, a spin system may be
completely anonymous. As more information is gained the spin system could
be allocated a residue type, and then finally a sequence position.

The various tabs of this popup break the spin system information into
several sections, with the aim of avoiding clutter, but the underlying spin
system entities represented in all the tables is the same and all carry an
indication of the current assignment status. The differences are only a
matter of presentation. Selections made in any of the spin system tables
dictate which are used for the upper "Display" buttons or the lower panel
of buttons. The four tables sub-divide the spin system information as
follows:

* The "Assignments" tab lists the names of the individual resonances that are
  grouped by each spin system. Also the user is able to set a name for the
  spin system, shich will be displayed on spectra in the absense of any
  residue assignment information.

* The "Seq. Links" tab is used to display how spin systems have been
  connected as sequential neighbours. Such links are independent of a
  full residue assignment, and usually derive from the peak matching
  performed by tools like the `Protein Sequence Assignment`_ option.
  Often spin systems are connected as sequential neighbours before
  they are fitted into a protein chain to give the final residue assignment.

* The "Shifts" tab displays the chemical shifts of the resonances that are
  contained by each spin system.  The actual values displayed come from the
  from shift list selected at the top.

* The "Details" tab allows the user to make verbose textual comments for
  each spin system. This is particularly useful for recording thoughts that
  relate to assignment possibilities.

**Button Functions**

The various functions available as buttons operate on the spin system  (or
spin systems where appropriate) that have been selected in the current
table; using left mouse click +/- <Ctrl>/<Shift>. The "Display" functions
at the top are designed to locate the selected spectrum window so so that it
displays the resonances positions from the selected spin system, although
only appropriate resonances are used according to axis/isotope type and
spectrum width. In this way the user can find amide strips in an HNH window
or HC strips in a HCH window. The "Display Cells" option is the same as the
"Display Strips" option in most regards but differs in that the strips are
sub-divided into cells, if resonances from the spin system are visible on
that axis. This is handy to show the points of resonance intersection,
e.g. for amino acid side chain assignment.

The various Assign/Deassign buttons naturally control how a spin system is
linked to residue information. Assignments may be made (or broken) to
specific residues, residue type only or in a tentative/speculative manner.
Although these functions are often handy, spin systems will automatically
be assigned to the relevant residue if one of the contained resonances
is assigned elsewhere to a specific atom in a residue; typically
residue assignments are make when resonances are assigned to atoms
via the `Assignment Panel`_.

The "Show" functions are used to show tables of the spectrum peaks and
resonances that connect to selected spin systems, and from these the user
may then navigate within spectrum windows and perform assignment from these
other contexts.

**Caveats & Tips**

If a shift appears to be missing within a spin system I could be that a
resonance is simply not assigned in an experiment that uses the selected
shift list, in this instance there may be a shift in a different list.

To expedite finding particular spin systems within a large table the user
can filter the display to only particular spin system types using the
"Status" pulldown menu at the top. Alternatively the user can click on a
"?" in the headings of a column to filter the table rows according to a
user-specified value.
