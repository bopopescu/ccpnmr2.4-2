<h1>Experiments : Experiments<a class="headerlink" href="#experiments-experiments" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>Curate Experiment Parameters</strong></p>
<p>This popup window is used to control parameters that relate to the NMR
experiment entities within a CCPN project. It should be noted that an
experiment is specifically a record of <em>what was done</em>, not a reference to the
data that was obtained; this is what Analysis refers to as a spectrum. Also,
an experiment doesn&#8217;t just refer to what kind of NMR experiment was performed,
but rather to something that was done on a particular occasion to a particular
sample. The kinds of information that are stored at the experiment level
describe how the experiment was performed and how certain data that derives
from the experiment should be interpreted. Several tabs are used to sub-divide
the popup window into  several sections to control different aspects of the
experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Main &#8220;Experiments&#8221; Tab</strong></p>
<p>This table is the main display of all if the NMR experiments described within
the CCPN project. Each experiment may refer to one or more spectra (and even
an FID) that resulted from the experimental operation; the names of these are
listed in the &#8220;Data Sources&#8221; column. Several experimental parameters may be
adjusted in this table and, as far as resonance assignment is concerned, the
most important of these are the &#8220;Shift List&#8221; and &#8220;Mol Systems&#8221;. It should
be noted that the &#8220;Shift Ref&#8221; column can only be configured if chemical
shift reference details have been entered at the &#8220;Shift References&#8221; tab.</p>
<p>The shift list of an experiment states how chemical shift measurements should
be grouped. An experiment&#8217;s assignments, on the peak of its spectra, only
contribute to the chemical shift measurenemts in one shift list. In normal
operation each shift list corresponds to a given set of conditions, where
resonance positions in spectra a fairly static. Different experiments may use
different shift lists if their sample conditions are different enough to cause
peaks to move. Accordingly, a resonance derived from a given atom may have
several different recorded chemical shift values, each of which resides in a
different chemical shift list. Because each experiment is associated with a
single shift list it is thus known which chemical shift average the
assignments in its spectra contribute to and which chemical shift values to
look at when suggesting assignments for peaks. The shift list that an
experiment is linked to may be changed at any time, and when an experiment is
moved from one shift list to another (which may be new and empty) the
contributions that its spectrum peaks make to the calculation of average
chemical shift values will automatically be adjusted; the experiments that are
linked to a given shift list dictate which peaks to average chemical shift
values over.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Mol Systems&#8221; for an experiment specify which molecular systems were
present in the sample. In essence this means which group of molecular chains
the spectrum peaks, that come from the experiment, could be assigned to (caused
by). In normal operation the molecular information need not specifically be
set in this table, because the connection is made automatically when a peak is
assigned to a resonance that is known to be from a specific atom in a specific
residue. Once an experiment is associated with a particular molecular system,
subsequent attempts to assign its peaks to atoms in a different molecular system will
trigger a warning. The molecular system for an experiment may nonetheless be
set via this table. Sometimes this is to preemptively associate particular
experiments, and hence spectra, with specific molecular systems so that there
is less chance of accidentally assigning a peak to the wrong thing. The
molecular system, and hence residues, that an experiment is linked to is used
to facilitate several operations in Analysis. For example, when operating on a
peak to associate one of its assigned resonances with an atom, the molecular
system link allows the correct group of chains to be displayed
automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment Types</strong></p>
<p>This table is used to specify what kind of NMR experiment was done for each of
the experiment records within the project. The general idea is that the basic
magnetisation transfer pathway is given and how this relates to the
experimental dimensions. Setting such information helps facilitate several
operations in Analysis. For example when making NMR derived distance
restraints only peaks from &#8220;through-space&#8221; experiments like NOESY are listed.
Also, and perhaps most importantly, the linking of experimental dimensions to
references, which correspond to particular points of the magnetisation transfer
pathway, enables the assignment system to have knowledge of experimental
dimensions that are linked together via covalent &#8220;one-bond&#8221; connectivity.
Thus, if an experiment is set to be of 15N HSQC type, then it is known that
any spectrum peaks represent one-bond correlations between hydrogen and
nitrogen. This dictates what the isotope type of any assignments must be, and
if a peak dimension is assigned to a specific atom then the assignment on the
other peak dimension must be to the covalently bound atom.</p>
<p>Setting the experiment type means setting the &#8216;Full Type&#8217; column. The many
possibilities and difficult names makes this hard to do directly, and we have
tried to help with the process. The &#8216;Type Synonym&#8217; column also sets the &#8216;Full
Type&#8217; column but gives alternative and more human-readable names like &#8216;HNCA&#8217;
instead of &#8216;H[N[CA]]&#8217; or &#8216;15N HSQC-NOESY&#8217; instead of &#8216;H[N]_H.NOESY&#8217;. Some
&#8216;Type Synonyms&#8217; correspond to more than one Full Type; anything in the &#8216;Alt
Types&#8217; is an alternative Full Type. The possibilities given for these columns
are filtered, so that experiments that do not fit the nuclei on the axes are
not shown. The most common experiments are shown at the top of the selection
menu, the rest can be found in one or more of the categories lower down. The
&#8216;Categories&#8217; column divides experiments into a few rough groups and are used
to filter the possibilities in the other columns. Experiments that could
belong to more than one group are listed only in the most &#8216;interesting&#8217; one.
The &#8216;use external&#8217; category is a special case; it means that the program
should use the information in the &#8216;External Source&#8217; and &#8216;External Name&#8217;
columns to set the Full Type. This option is selected automatically when you
are loading a spectrum that contains information about the Full Type. At the
moment the program understands only Bruker pulse program names, and only if
they follow the standard naming conventions used by the Bruker Applications
department.</p>
<p>In normal operation the user specifies the type of NMR experiment that was run
by selecting options in the &#8220;Category&#8221;, &#8220;Type Synonym&#8221; and &#8220;Full Type&#8221; columns.
If the full CCPN name of the experiment type is known then the user can go
straight for the &#8220;Full Type&#8221;, but selecting the category and/or synonym first
allows the number available options to be reduced dramatically; without this
all possible experiment types that have matching isotopes are shown.
Setting the category for the NMR experiment gives a rough sub division between
through-bond, through-space, quantification and other types. Strictly speaking
an experiment may belong to more than one category, but in this system it is
only listed in the least populous. For example a 15N HSQC-NOESY has both
through-bond and though-space transfers but is categorised as through-space.
If the category for an experiment is unknown, or not particularly helpful, the
user may set the synonym in the first instance. The &#8220;synonym&#8221; of an
experimental type in Analysis is a common human-readable name, for example
&#8220;HNCA&#8221; or &#8220;15N HSQC NOESY&#8221;, but this may still not be sufficient to fully
specify the exact NMR experiment that was run. To do this the full CCPN type
should  be considered.  The External Source and corresponding name columns are
only used in situations where the loading of a spectrum specifies what kind of
experiment was run. At present this only occurs for data loaded from Bruker
files, and then only if the pulse sequence name in the parameters is known to
the system. Nevertheless, if this data is present the experiment type
information can be automatically be filled in.</p>
<p>The full CCPN type for an experiment uses a special nomenclature that is
described in the CCPN <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17031528">experiment nomenclature paper</a> (slightly out of date
now). In essence the user can distinguish between different magnetisation
transfer pathways, some of which may have the same common name (synonym). For
example a 15N HSQC-TOCSY could have either the HSQC step or the TOCSY step
first. In this instance the system offers a choice between H[N]_H.TOCSY (HSQC
first) and H_H[N].TOCSY (TOCSY first). The experiment naming system for the
full CCPN type is fairly complex, and is designed to give a precise
specification of the magnetisation steps, which atom sites they visit and what
measurements are made; giving rise to an experimental dimension. It should be
noted however, that this system does not describe the precise NMR pulse
sequence that was used. For example no distinction is made between HSQC and
HMQC. The essential features of the nomenclature are as follows: capital
letters indicate atom sites that were recorded and result in an experimental
dimension; lower case letters are atom sites that are part of the pathway but
not recorded, e.g. carbonyl in H[N[co[CA]]]; square brackets represent
out-and-back transfers; curly brackets with &#8220;|&#8221; sub-divisions represent
alternative pathways; underscores represent transfers that are not one-bond or
J-coupling (the transfer type is listed after at the end after a dot).</p>
<p>The lower tables are used to show how the dimensions of the actual experiment
relate to the reference dimensions that described in the experiment type. Even
when an experiment type is set it will not always be possible to
automatically determine which of the experimental dimensions relates to which
part of the magnetisation transfer pathway. For example a 3D HCCH TOCSY
experiment (full type HC_cH.TOCSY) has two hydrogen dimensions; one dimension
is the hydrogen bound to the measured carbon, and one dimension is the
hydrogen in the acquisition dimension. Deciding which is which is crucial for
the correct assignment and interpretation of spectra. The problem only arises
when there are two or more dimensions with the same nucleus. Sometimes
Analysis guesses wrong and the user has to check. Changing the dimension
mapping is a matter of looking in the lower left table and seeing how one
dimension relates to another. Each dimension that has a direct transfer to
another recorded dimension is listed. For example, in an HCCH TOCSY dimension
1 (hydrogen) might be &#8216;onebond&#8217; to dimension 3 (carbon), but the user may know
that it is actually dimension 2 that is really &#8216;onebond&#8217; to the carbon. This
problem may be fixed by double-clicking either the &#8220;First Dim&#8221; or the &#8220;Second
Dim to to change the transfer pathways so that dimension 3 (carbon) is listed
as &#8216;onebond&#8217; to dimension 2 (hydrogen) (the other rows in the table will
adjust automatically). The Numbering of dimensions in this table is the same
as that presented when assigning a peak, i.e. in the <a class="reference external" href="EditAssignmentPopup.html">Assignment Panel</a>. It
helps to know that dimension &#8216;1&#8217; is usually (but not always) the acquisition
dimension.</p>
<p>The lower right &#8220;Reference Dimension Mapping&#8221; is an alternative way of looking
at the same information and shows how the experimental dimensions have been
mapped to their reference counterpart in the experiment type database. Here,
the &#8220;Ref Measurement&#8221; column can be used to follow the steps in the
magnetisation transfer pathway by following increasing measurement numbers.
Changing the &#8220;Ref Exp Dim&#8221; column in this table is equivalent to making
changes in the lower left table, but is perhaps more difficult to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Details, Instruments and Shift References</strong></p>
<p>The &#8220;Experimental Details&#8221; table is used to list and edit details about the
recorded experiments in terms of its physical setup. The user may specify
which instruments  were used and information about the sample and NMR tube. It
should be noted that in order to specify a spectrometer or probe the
specification for the instrument must first be entered in the &#8220;NMR
Instruments&#8221; tab. Currently, none of the NMR details given in this table have
any influence on resonance assignment or NMR data analysis, although spinning
information may be used for solid-state spectra at some point. However, any
experimental details entered into the CCPN project will be present when
submissions to the BioMagResBank database are made; initially using the
<a class="reference external" href="EntryCompletionPopup.html">CcpNmr ECI</a>.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Shift References&#8221; table is use to enter chemical shift reference
information into the CCPN project. This may them be linked to experiments via
the first &#8220;Experiments&#8221; tab, and such information is required for database
deposition. To add a chemical shift reference specification the user first
clicks on either &#8220;Add Internal Reference&#8221; (internal to the sample) or &#8220;Add
External Reference&#8221; as appropriate. Then for the rows that appear in the table
the user double-clicks to edit the columns to specify: which atom in which
kind of molecule was used, what the reference value and unit is, and whether
the reference is direct or indirect. A reference atom allows the direct
referencing of resonances that have the same kind of isotope, but other
isotopes may be referenced indirectly by using a shift ratio to relate to a
direct reference.</p>
<p>The &#8220;NMR Instruments&#8221; section contains two table that allows the user to add
descriptions of the NMR probe and spectrometer that were used during the
experiments. To achieve this the user adds a new specification for the
appropriate kind of instrument then double-clicks to fill in the details for
each of the rows that appears in the table.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats &amp; Tips</strong></p>
<p>An experiment may be linked temporarily with a new shift list; selecting
&#8220;&lt;New&gt;&#8221; in the Shift List column of the first tab then reseting the shift list
back to the original one, in order to make a shift list that contains only
chemical shift value for that experiment at that time. Without any experiment
links these chemical shift values will not alter as peaks and assignments
change.</p>
