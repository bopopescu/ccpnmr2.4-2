<h1>Assignment : Pick &amp; Assign From Roots<a class="headerlink" href="#assignment-pick-assign-from-roots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>Pick and Assign Peaks Based on Locations in Root Spectra</strong></p>
<p>This popup window is designed to help in the early stages of peak picking and
resonance assignment. The main idea is that certain &#8220;root&#8221; spectra, typically
an HNCO or 15N HSQC, with initialised peak lists are used as a basis for
locating and assigning peaks in other spectra that overlap in the relevant
dimensions. For example you may use the amide peak positions in a 15N HSQC
spectrum to pick peaks in restricted regions of a 3D HNCACB spectrum and copy
amide resonance assignments to the amide dimensions of the 3D spectrum where
they overlap with the HSQC peaks.</p>
<p>Often the root spectrum, that is the source of peak position and assignment
information, will only be assigned in an anonymous way; the peaks will have
spin system and resonance numbers (e.g. &#8220;{7}[4][5]&#8221;) and not link to any
particular residues or atoms. For this tool it doesn&#8217;t matter whether the root
peaks carry full assignments or not, all that is important is that there are
some peaks to specify locations and some form of assignment to copy. The
easiest way to setup initial assignments on a root spectrum, after picking
some peaks, is to use the <a class="reference external" href="InitRootAssignmentsPopup.html">Initialise Root Resonances</a> option.</p>
<p>In normal operation the user chooses a peak list to act as the the source of
the root assignments and positions, and maybe a spectrum window to view those
peaks in. Next the assignable spectra that are to be the target for peak
picking and/or assignment are chosen. Firstly, the user adds and removes
spectrum windows to the &#8220;Target Windows&#8221; list, the spectra to be operated on
are then selected from those that are visible in these windows. By selecting
different kinds of window different kinds of spectra may be operated on, so
for example the user could both work with HCN spectra and HHN spectra with the
same HSQC root. This tool is largely visual and it is important to be able to
see the locations that are bing considered (e.g. amide), hence the user is
only presented with assignable spectra that can potentially be seen. The
&#8220;Assignable Spectra&#8221; section is filled with the spectra for the target
windows that may be assigned, and the user double-clicks in the &#8220;Active?&#8221;
to set whether the individual spectra should be operated on or not (for
peak picking and assignment).</p>
<p>One windows and spectra are setup is is advisable to consider the &#8220;Tolerances&#8221;
tab that controls how wide a search region is used to pick and assign peaks
relative to the positions of the reference, root peaks. The user can also
setup exclusions to avoid picking peaks near the water signal (e.g. in 15N
HSQC-NOESY) or homonuclear diagonal.</p>
<p>The last &#8220;Link Peaks&#8221; tab is the one that remains active while the user is
actually running the the peak picking and assignment functions. Here, the main
table lists all of the peaks in the root peak list that are used for position
and assignment references. Clicking on a row in this table, assuming the
relevant navigations are checked above, will cause the location of any root
and target spectrum windows to move in order to show the root (e.g. amide)
location for the selected row. Even if peaks are not peaked or assigned this
tool may be used for efficient coordination in window. Typically clicking  on
an HSQC peak will present an amide position in 3D target windows, locating the
X and Z axes, so that the user can see the column of peaks that may be
picked/assigned.</p>
<p>For a single selected root location, the user may transfer assignments or pick
peaks <em>and</em> transfer assignments, by clicking the appropriate buttons in the
&#8220;Pick &amp; Assign Functions&#8221; section. This is one-by-one way of working is the
safest because the user is presented will the spectra for each location and
will be able to view the result of the peak picking and assignment. The
equivalent &#8220;Process-all Functions&#8221; will work though all root locations in the
table picking and assigning peaks en masse, according to the set tolerances,
in a quick but less controlled manner.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Assign Non-root Resonances&#8221; options are present so that you can give a
starting assignment to the assigned spectra in the dimension that does not
match the root location. For example, you could add 13C resonances to an
HNcoCA spectrum or 1H resonances to the indirect dimension 1H dimension of a
15N HSQC-TOCSY. These &#8220;non-root&#8221; resonance numbers will all be new and unique,
thus this operation should only be used for types of experiment where the is
one peak for each non-root resonance. For example HNcoCA has one peak per CA
resonance by HNCA usually has two, so the function is only recommended for the
former.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats &amp; Tips</strong></p>
<p>This tool can be operated in two slightly different ways, according to the
preference of the user and the quality of the spectra. The &#8220;Process-all&#8221;
functions can be used to start with, given fairly strict tolerances, but the
user should then go through each root position checking for and tidying up
mistakes (picking noise &amp; artefacts for example). Alternatively the root
locations could be picked and assigned one-by-one so the user can spot
problems as they occur.</p>
<p>Although the same tolerances, set via the &#8220;Tolerances&#8221; tab, are used for both
peak picking and for resonance assignment some peaks that can be picked may
not be assigned with the same settings. Whereas the peak picking is done
relative to the root location the assignment, in common with the rest if
Analysis, is relative to the current chemical shift average and thus may
differ from the root location. Widening the tolarances a little, or increasing
the chemical shift weighting of the root spectrum can allow assignments to be
made if they were previously out of bounds.</p>
