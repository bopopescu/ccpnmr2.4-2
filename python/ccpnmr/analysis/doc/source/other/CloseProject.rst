Project : Close

**Close the current CCPN project**

This option allows you to stop working with a CCPN project, but
leaves the Analysis software still in operation, without any active project. 

When selecting this option the user is asked to confirm the operation. If
confirmed the user will then be asked whether to save the previously open
project, if it has been modified.

Once there is no active CCPN project the program will close any popup windows
and disable almost all of the menu options. The user is still able to load
another project from disk or make an entirely new project, whereupon the
program's functionality becomes active again.
